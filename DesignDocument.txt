*** Refraction ***

- Add member to "ray" storing refractive index of medium ray is travelling in

- Add refractive index member to "Material" struct

- When ray intersects, check ray.dir.dot(surfaceNormal)
	assuming all normals are pointing OUTWARD of surface
	and all object are closed.
	- dotProduct == 0, not entering material
	-	> 0, ray.dir same dir as normal, so ray hits INSIDE of material
	-   < 0, ray.dir opposite to normal, ray hits OUTSIDE of material

- Calculate refracting angle, and create refractRay if needed
	- if to implement having adjacent refecting materials
		need to advance ray pass intersection and check what material is there
	- Otherwise, just assume each refracting obj is surrounded by air

- ReFLECTing angle may have to be reversed in +/- if ray hits INSIDE of material
	since normal is pointing outward.
