CSC418 A4 PartA Only
--------------------

Implemented "intersect" for UnitSquare and UnitSphere

- based on formulas from notes & textbook
- basically, solving equations for t_value
- if at t_value, ray is within the primitive, it's an intersection
- store intersection info into ray.intersection


Implemented PointLight::Shade

- All 3 component of Phong model are calculated separately
- Lighting mode set by bitwise-OR to global variable "_render_mode"
- Modes definitions in light_source.h
- "Signature" mode simply display scene object diffuse color without lighting adjustment
- Individual component of Phong follows calculations from notes & textbook


Finished implementationof Raytracer::render

- Added codes to generate ray and convert to world coordinate.


Images
- "sig1" & "sig2" generated with "_render_mode = MODE_SIGNATURE"
- "diffuse1" & "diffuse2" generated with "_render_mode = (mode)(MODE_DIFFUSE | MODE_AMBIENT)"
- "phong1" & "phong2" generated with "_render_mode = MODE_FULLPHONG"
